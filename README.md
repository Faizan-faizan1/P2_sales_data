## 📌 Project Summary
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a fictional sales dataset to derive actionable business insights. Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the project explores trends in sales performance across different products, categories, and time periods. Key visualizations include daily/monthly sales trends, category-wise revenue distribution, and product-wise performance analysis.

The project is structured with clean, modular directories:

raw_data/ and clean_data/ folders for dataset versioning

Visuals stored as .png for reporting

A well-documented Jupyter Notebook for analysis reproducibility

This project showcases data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills critical for real-world data analysis tasks.

## ✅ Highlights:
Cleaned and structured raw sales data

Visualized trends in product performance and customer behavior

Performed time-series breakdown (daily, weekly, monthly)

Built a professional GitHub-ready repository
